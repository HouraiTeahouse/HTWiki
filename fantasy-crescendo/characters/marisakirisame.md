|**Attack**|**Description**|**Damage**|**Knockback**|
|:--|:--|:--|:--|
|**Ground Attacks**|
|Neutral Combo|Marisa extends her hand outwards and fires a small flurry of stars from her palm. Stars will continue to spray for as long as the input is held down (similar to other rapid-jab attacks).|N/A|N/A|
|Dash Attack|Marisa gets on her broom and charges through any opponents on her path before getting off.|N/A|N/A|
|**Strong Attacks**|
|Forward Tilt|Marisa jabs forward with the handle of the broom.|N/A|N/A|
|Up Tilt|Marisa traces an thin arc of magic with her finger above her head that bursts into stars.|N/A|N/A|
|Down Tilt|Marisa does a sweep-kick from crouch position.|N/A|N/A|
|**Smash Attacks**|
|Forward Smash|~~Marisa launches herself at the opponent, butt-first.  Soku-esque.~~ TBD|N/A|N/A|
|Up Smash|Marisa holds hakkero above her head and after a short startup, fires a short-range blast.  Marisa's arm/knees may buckle from the recoil.|N/A|N/A|
|Down Smash|Marisa sweeps both hands down, firing on both sides of her exploding stars.|N/A|N/A|
|**Throws**|
|Pummel|TBD|N/A|N/A|
|Forward Throw|TBD|N/A|N/A|
|Back Throw|TBD|N/A|N/A|
|Up Throw|TBD|N/A|N/A|
|Down Throw|TBD|N/A|N/A|
|**Aerial Attacks**|
|Neutral Aerial|While on broom, Marisa spins around horizontally, striking behind with the brush of the broom.|N/A|N/A|
|Up Aerial|Marisa's broom materializes beneath her feet as she surfs into a somersault, striking above with the brush of the broom.|N/A|N/A|
|Forward Aerial|Marisa sticks out her hand and fires a blast from the hakkero after a short startup.|N/A|N/A|
|Back Aerial|Marisa punches behind her, her fist exploding into a star.|N/A|N/A|
|Down Aerial|Similar to fair, except the direction is diagonally-down.|N/A|N/A|
|**Special Attacks**|
|Neutral Special|Illusion laser/Master Spark.  Marisa leans back before firing a laser with the hakkero (held with both hands).  Three different charge states.  No-charge leads to single weak laser without hitlag or hitstun.  Low-to-mid charge hits will increase the number of hitboxes that hit the opponent and put them into hitlag, but not hitstun (think of how getting hit by a multi-hit move during 12.3 Typhoon works).  Width and startup of the move  scales with charge. A full charge corresponds to a full Master Spark - big wide hitbox that spans the stage, big knockback and damage, and of course big startup.|N/A|N/A|
|Up Special|Marisa rides broom directionally, shooting stars behind.  (lots of landing lag, but perhaps cancelable with jump as a horizontal movement option?)|N/A|N/A|
|Side Special|Napalm Blast.  Marisa fires a slower-moving green projectile from both hands (not hakkero).  Impact should create a persistent hitbox that burns.  (Similar to PK Fire?)|N/A|N/A|
|Down Special|Unstable Potion.  Marisa stands in place, grabbing a potion from her bag and holding it in her hand.  The potion cycles through various effects over time - damage, explosive, slow, increased damage on-hit.  Releasing the input will cause Marisa to throw the potion; opponents will be affected accordingly if they come into contact with a thrown potion.  Potion cycles through options faster over time, but if held too long the potion will explode in Marisaâ€™s hand and cause self-damage.|N/A|N/A|
